      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Concentration, also known as 'Match Match', 'Memory', 'Pelmanism', 'Shinkei-suijaku', 'Pexaso' or 'Pairs', is a card game in which all of the cards are laid facedown on a surface and two cards are flipped over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
      <h3>What is fun about this game?</h3>
      <p>Concentration aids in memory and enhances one's ability to focus. It increases observational powers and can in rare cases lead to super enlarged craniums and exotic mental powers.</p>
